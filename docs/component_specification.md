# Component Specification

## Software components
High level description of at least 3 software components, specifying:
* what it does;
* inputs it requires; and
* outputs it provides.

1.Plot_transformer
* The plot transformer aimed at transforming the plot data which is differently fomatted into a unified dataframe. The inputs includes file of different format such as .shp files, .dbf files or .cpg files which are all the plot data of the forest which was generated by other measuring software such as XXXXXX. And plot transformer is meant to use packages like pandas and geopandas to read these files in and output a unified dataframe such as a .csv file or a .txt file which is easy to manipulate and convenient for subsequent process.

2.Lidar_transformer
* The lidar transformer take data generated by Lidar in and use packages inside python to read these files and output a unified dataframe.

4.Tester


Example software components:
* **data manager**, which provides a simplified interface to your data and provides application specific features (e.g., querying data subsets); and
* **visualization manager**, which displays data frames as a plot.

## Interactions to accomplish use cases.
Describe how the above software components interact to accomplish at least one of your use cases.

## Preliminary plan.
1. Scripts/functions for pre-processing field-measured forest inventory data into consistent format
2. Classes/functions for generating a 3D point cloud for a single tree from field-measured attributes
3. Classes/functions for combining multiple trees into a single point cloud
4. Functions for plotting 3D point clouds
5. Process for generating a Poisson Surface mesh from lidar data
6. Process for calculating the distance of points on a regular 3D grid from the lidar-derived mesh
7. Function for querying this distance array with a set of simulated points, based on interpolation of query points using the regular 3D grid with pre-calculated distances from the lidar mesh.
8. Implementation of an optimization algorithm which adjusts tree simulation parameters, calculates the distance of the simulated points from the lidar-derived mesh, and iteratively minimizes this distance function.
