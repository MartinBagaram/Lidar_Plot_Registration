# Component Specification

## Software components
High level description of at least 3 software components, specifying:
* what it does;
* inputs it requires; and
* outputs it provides.

1.Plot_transformer
* The plot transformer aimed at transforming the plot data which is differently fomatted into a unified dataframe. The inputs includes file of different format such as .shp files, .dbf files or .cpg files which are all the plot data of the forest which was generated by other measuring software such as XXXXXX. And plot transformer is meant to use packages like pandas and geopandas to read these files in and output a unified dataframe such as a .csv file or a .txt file which is easy to manipulate and convenient for subsequent process.

2.Lidar_transformer
* The lidar transformer take data generated by Lidar in and use packages inside python to read these files and output a unified dataframe.

4.Tester


Example software components:
* **data manager**, which provides a simplified interface to your data and provides application specific features (e.g., querying data subsets); and
* **visualization manager**, which displays data frames as a plot.
